    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>My favorite pressure cooker beef short ribs recipe. The complex flavors come from the combination of prunes, leeks, fennel and chipotle chile. Quick and convenient.</p1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed</li> 
        <li> 1 teaspoon ground coriander</li> 
        <li> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li> 
        <li> 3 to 4 pounds bone-in beef short ribs</li> 
        <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil or other fat (like bacon fat or duck fat), more as needed</li> 
        <li> 3 leeks, whites only, chopped</li> 
        <li> 2 large fennel bulbs, diced</li> 
        <li> 4 garlic cloves, minced</li> 
        <li> 1 tablespoon chipotle chile powder</li> 
        <li> 1 tablespoon tomato paste</li> 
        <li> 1 cup dry red wine, such as Merlot, Pinot Noir, Chianti or Cabernet Sauvignon</li> 
        <li> ½ cup pitted prunes, diced</li> 
        <li> Fennel fronds or sliced scallions, or both, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rub salt, coriander and pepper all over beef and let marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour, or, ideally, overnight.</li>
        <li>Sear beef on cast iron skillet on medium high until evenly browned on all sides, about 2 minutes per side in batches. Transfer them to pressure cooker.</li>
        <li>Add leeks, fennel and pinch of salt to hot pan and cook until soft, about 8 minutes, then add garlic, chile powder and tomato paste; cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in wine. Add prunes and beef to pressure coooker</li>
        <li>Cover, then cook for 50 minutes on high pressure. Manually release pressure. If sauce seems thin, pull out beef pieces and reduce sauce using sauté function.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate overnight and skim fat </li> 
        <li>Garnish with fennel fronds or scallions.</li>
    </ol>
