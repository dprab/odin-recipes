    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>Easy weeknight chicken tacos - pressure cooking really cuts the cooking time down. Sweetness from the honey and spiciness from the chipotles are a nice combo.</p1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 to 4 canned chipotles in adobo, finely chopped, plus 2 tablespoons adobo sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus additional as needed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
        <li>Warmed tortillas, for serving</li>
        <li>Pickled onion </li>
        <li>Sliced or cubed avocado, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the chicken, chipotles and adobo sauce, honey, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and cumin in an electric pressure cooker. Cook on high pressure for 13 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally for 5 minutes; then release the remaining pressure manually.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken to a bowl or cutting board using tongs. Shred the chicken with two forks. If you’d like to reduce the sauce, set to sauté and simmer, 5 minutes. Add the chicken back into the pot.</li>
        <li>Stir in the black beans and a squeeze of lime juice, set to sauté and let the beans warm through, 2 to 3 minutes. Taste and add more salt or lime juice if necessary. Serve in tortillas with pickled onions and avocado.</li>
    </ol>
