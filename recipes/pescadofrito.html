    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>Easy and quick fried whole fish. Red snapper doesn't have small bones and the skin crisps nicely when fried. This is a South American recipe, but it reminds me of fried fish that my mom makes served with fish curry. It also takes me back to the beach town I grew up in Malaysia.</p1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the adobo marinade</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lime, juiced (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 medium garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon store-bought or homemade sazón</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>For the Fish</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (1½- to 2-pound) red snapper, cleaned, scaled and gilled</li>
            <li>1½ quarts vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Lime wedges, hot sauce and chopped cilantro leaves, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the adobo: Combine all the dry adobo ingredients and grind them together in a  mortar and pestle. Add the garlic, oil and lime juice.</li>
        <li>Prepare the fish: Make three shallow crosswise cuts on both sides of the surface of the fish skin, then place it in a deep container with a lid or a large resealable bag. Pour adobo over, rubbing it into the skin, head and cavity. Let marinate for at least 30 minutes at room temperature, or 2 to 3 hours in the fridge. If marinating longer, let the fish come to room temperature 30 minutes before frying.</li>
        <li>In a wide, heavy-bottomed pot large enough to submerge your fish, pour in enough oil to reach a depth of at least 2 inches. Heat over high until oil is simmering and reaches 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with paper towels and set aside.</li>
        <li>Once the oil comes to temperature, pick the marinated fish up by the tail, shake off excess marinade, and lower it head-first into simmering oil. Use a pair of tongs to gently nudge the fish to prevent it from sticking to the pot. It’ll be very active at first, so have a splatter shield handy.</li>
        <li>Using a heat-safe ladle, baste any unsubmerged fish with hot oil repeatedly, ensuring fish cooks evenly. Fry until it turns golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes, watching carefully and removing immediately if it starts to get dark.</li>
        <li>Using an extra-long fish spatula, or a set of heatproof tongs and a heatproof spatula, carefully lift the fish out of the oil and transfer it to the lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Let rest for 2 to 3 minutes. Garnish with lime wedges, hot sauce and cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
